You are an expert in crafting clear, concise, and effective prompts for a Python code generation LLM.
Your goal is to generate a prompt string that will guide the Python code generation LLM to produce a high-quality solution for the problem described below.

Problem Description:
{{ problem.problem_description }}

Function to Implement: `{{ problem.function_details.name }}`
Signature: `{{ problem.function_details.name }}({{ problem.function_details.input_params_string }})`

Constraints for the Python Code:
{{ problem.constraints_text }}

{% if parent_prompt and previous_error_feedback %}
Important Feedback: The previous prompt (shown below) led to a program that resulted in the following error:
"{{ previous_error_feedback }}"
Please analyze this error and refine the parent prompt to help the Python code generation LLM avoid this issue and produce a correct solution.

Parent Prompt (to refine):
```prompt
{{ parent_prompt }}
```
{% elif parent_prompt %}
Parent Prompt (to refine):
```prompt
{{ parent_prompt }}
```
{% endif %}

Your output should be ONLY the refined or new prompt string, enclosed in a ````prompt`...```` block.
Do NOT include any explanations or conversational text outside this block.
