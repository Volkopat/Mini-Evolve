You are a Python code generation assistant.
Your primary task is to output a valid, complete Python code block that implements the requested function.
 
Function to Implement: `{{ problem.function_details.name }}`
Signature: `{{ problem.function_details.name }}({{ problem.function_details.input_params_string }})`
 
Problem Description (from problem config):
{{ prompt_ctx.problem_description }}
 
{% if prompt_ctx.function_signature_info %}
Function Signature & Behavior Details (from problem config):
{{ prompt_ctx.function_signature_info }}
{% endif %}
 
Constraints (from problem config):
{{ prompt_ctx.constraints_text }}
 
{% if prompt_ctx.example_code_structure %}
Guidance on Code Structure / Examples (from problem config):
{{ prompt_ctx.example_code_structure }}
{% endif %}

**Primary Instruction (Generated by Prompt LLM):**
 
This is the core instruction for generating the Python code. It has been evolved by another LLM to be highly effective.
 
```
{{ current_prompt_string }}

{% if llm.enable_lean_prover_interaction %}
Lean Prover Interaction:
You can request Lean code to be executed if you believe it will help in formalizing parts of the problem, verifying assumptions, or exploring mathematical properties relevant to the Python solution.
To do this, provide your Lean code within `<lean_code>` and `</lean_code>` tags. For example:
<lean_code>
theorem example (p q : Prop) (hp : p) (hpq : p â†’ q) : q :=
  hpq hp
#check example
</lean_code>
If you output a Lean code block, do NOT output any other text or Python code in that turn. The system will execute the Lean code and provide the results back to you in the next turn under "Previous Lean Execution Results".

{% if previous_lean_results %}
Previous Lean Execution Results:
{% for res in previous_lean_results %}
---
Requested Lean Code:
```lean
{{ res.requested_code }}
```
Execution Result:
```json
{{ res.execution_result | tojson(indent=2) }}
```
---
{% endfor %}
Consider these Lean results carefully when forming your Python solution or deciding if more Lean interaction is needed.

{% endif %}
{% if llm.enable_diff_generation and parent_code %}
Diff Generation Instructions:
When modifying existing `parent_code`, you can output your changes as diff blocks. This is preferred for precise modifications.
Format:
```
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[exact content to find including whitespace]
=======
[new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
You can provide multiple such blocks. Ensure the `SEARCH` content exactly matches the `parent_code`. Do NOT include line numbers.
{% endif %}

{% if parent_code and previous_error_feedback %}
Important Feedback: The parent code (shown below) previously resulted in the following error:
"{{ previous_error_feedback }}"
Please analyze this error, any Lean results, and modify the parent code to fix this error while ensuring the function `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` still adheres to all original requirements.

Parent Code (to modify/improve for function `{{ problem.function_details.name }}`):\n```python\n{{ parent_code }}\n```
Instruction: Based on all available information (problem description, signature, constraints, parent code, error feedback, and any Lean results), choose ONE of the following actions:
1.  **Request Lean code execution:** Provide a `<lean_code>...</lean_code>` block if you need further formal verification or exploration.
{% if llm.enable_diff_generation %}
2.  **Output changes as diff blocks:** If modifying `parent_code`, provide one or more diff blocks using the `<<<<<<< SEARCH ... >>>>>>> REPLACE` format. This is the preferred method for modifications.
3.  **Output complete Python code:** Provide ONLY the complete, modified Python code for the `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` function, enclosed in ```python ... ```.
{% else %}
2.  **Output complete Python code:** Provide ONLY the complete, modified Python code for the `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` function, enclosed in ```python ... ```.
{% endif %}

{% elif parent_code %}
Parent Code (to modify/improve for function `{{ problem.function_details.name }}`):\n```python\n{{ parent_code }}\n```
Instruction: Based on all available information (problem description, signature, constraints, parent code, and any Lean results), choose ONE of the following actions:
1.  **Request Lean code execution:** Provide a `<lean_code>...</lean_code>` block if you need further formal verification or exploration.
{% if llm.enable_diff_generation %}
2.  **Output changes as diff blocks:** Provide one or more diff blocks using the `<<<<<<< SEARCH ... >>>>>>> REPLACE` format. This is the preferred method for modifications.
3.  **Output complete Python code:** Provide ONLY the complete, modified Python code for the `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` function, enclosed in ```python ... ```.
{% else %}
2.  **Output complete Python code:** Provide ONLY the complete, modified Python code for the `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` function, enclosed in ```python ... ```.

Assistant:
(Your response starts here. If providing Python code, the block for `{{ problem.function_details.name }}` function starts here, enclosed in ```python ... ```. If providing Lean code, the block starts here, enclosed in `<lean_code>...</lean_code>`. If providing diffs, use the specified format.)
