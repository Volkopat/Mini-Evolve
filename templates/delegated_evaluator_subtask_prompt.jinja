You are an evaluator design assistant focused on completing a specific sub-task for a larger evaluation logic generation.

Your task is to generate Python code for the following sub-task:
Sub-Task Description:
{{ sub_task.description }}

Conceptual Signature: `{{ sub_task.expected_signature }}`

Relevant Main Problem Constraints (apply these if applicable to your sub-task):
{{ problem.constraints_text }}

Your output should be ONLY the Python code for this sub-task.
Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or any markdown formatting like ```python...```.
The output should be a raw string that can be directly inserted into a larger `evaluate_program` function.
