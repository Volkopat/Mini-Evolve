You are a Python programming expert. Your task is to implement the `explore_chromatic_number_plane` function.
The problem is to determine the minimum number of colors needed to color the plane such that no two points at unit distance from each other have the same color. This is also known as the Hadwiger-Nelson problem.

The function signature is `explore_chromatic_number_plane(params: dict) -> dict`.

Since this is an unsolved mathematical problem, the function should not attempt to compute a definitive answer. Instead, it should focus on exploring the problem, potentially by:
1.  **Analyzing known bounds:** Research and incorporate the current known lower and upper bounds for the Hadwiger-Nelson problem (e.g., 4 <= chi <= 7).
2.  **Implementing graph-theoretic approaches:** Provide utilities or conceptual frameworks for analyzing finite subgraphs of the unit distance graph. For example, a function that can generate a unit distance graph for a finite set of points, or a function that can attempt to color such a graph.
3.  **Generating theoretical insights or conjectures:** The function could explore properties of the unit distance graph or propose strategies for constructing challenging configurations.
4.  **Formalizing aspects in Lean (optional but encouraged):** If `params` includes a directive for Lean formalization, the function could output Lean code snippets that define the problem's core concepts (e.g., unit distance graph, coloring) or formalize known results.

The `params` dictionary can contain various configurations, such as:
- `mode`: A string indicating the desired exploration mode (e.g., "bounds_analysis", "graph_coloring_utility", "lean_formalization").
- `points`: A list of 2D tuples representing points for graph analysis (if `mode` is "graph_coloring_utility").
- `max_distance_for_graph`: A float representing the maximum distance to consider for edges in a graph (if `mode` is "graph_coloring_utility").
- `lean_concept`: A string indicating which concept to formalize in Lean (e.g., "unit_distance_graph", "graph_coloring").

The function should return a dictionary containing the results of the exploration, which could include:
- `lower_bound`: The current known lower bound.
- `upper_bound`: The current known upper bound.
- `analysis_summary`: A string summarizing findings or insights.
- `lean_code`: A string containing generated Lean code.
- `graph_coloring_result`: A dictionary with coloring attempts or properties of a generated graph.
- `error`: A string describing any errors encountered.

Example usage (conceptual, actual implementation will depend on `params`):
```python
# Example for bounds analysis
result = explore_chromatic_number_plane(params={"mode": "bounds_analysis"})
print(result)
# Expected output: {'lower_bound': 4, 'upper_bound': 7, 'analysis_summary': 'The chromatic number of the plane is known to be between 4 and 7 inclusive.'}

# Example for generating a graph and attempting to color it (conceptual)
# This would require more sophisticated graph algorithms, but the function could provide the framework.
# This part is highly conceptual due to the complexity of arbitrary point sets.
# A simpler version might just return the adjacency list for given points.
points = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (0.5, 0.866)] # Equilateral triangle, all sides unit length
result = explore_chromatic_number_plane(params={"mode": "graph_coloring_utility", "points": points})
print(result)
# Expected output (conceptual): {'graph_coloring_result': {'nodes': 3, 'edges': 3, 'chromatic_number_estimate': 3, 'coloring': {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}}}

# Example for Lean formalization
result = explore_chromatic_number_plane(params={"mode": "lean_formalization", "lean_concept": "unit_distance_graph"})
print(result)
# Expected output (conceptual): {'lean_code': 'import topology.metric_space.basic\n\ndefinition unit_distance_graph (X : Type*) [metric_space X] : Prop := ...'}

    -- D = (0.5, -sqrt(3)/6) -- Center of equilateral triangle formed by A,B,C, but not unit distance to all.
    -- This is hard to get right without concrete coordinates.
    -- The Moser Spindle is typically defined as two rhombi sharing a vertex, with additional edges.
    -- A more abstract graph definition would be:
    -- vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
    -- edges E = { (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (4,7), (5,6), (6,7), (7,5) }
