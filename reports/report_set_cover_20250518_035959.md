        # This implies the remaining elements are simply not in *any* of the remaining subsets.
        # Let's refine the logic: if we break and uncovered_elements is not empty, it means the greedy failed to find a complete cover.
        # But the initial check says a cover *is* possible. This discrepancy could arise if subsets are empty or identical.
        # Let's assume the standard greedy behavior is expected: it keeps going until everything is covered or it runs out of subsets offering new elements.
        # The `while uncovered_elements:` loop condition is the primary driver. The break condition is a safeguard.
        # If the loop finishes and `uncovered_elements` is empty, the cover is complete.
        # If the loop breaks early and `uncovered_elements` is NOT empty, then despite the initial check, the greedy couldn't find a full cover.
        # In this specific implementation, the `max_newly_covered == 0` check *is* the condition where it runs out of subsets offering new elements.
        # If it hits this and `uncovered_elements` is still true, it means the remaining elements are not in any subset that hasn't been picked or that offered new elements when considered.
        # This is a state where the greedy cannot proceed. Given the NP-hard nature, failure to find a complete cover via greedy despite one existing is possible *if* the greedy choice leads to a dead end.
        # However, the standard proof of the greedy algorithm shows it covers all elements eventually if a cover exists. The max_newly_covered == 0 break should only be hit if uncovered_elements is empty, or if the initial check was wrong, or if the universe contains elements not in any subset. The initial check handles the last case.
        # Let's simplify: the loop runs until `uncovered_elements` is empty. The `max_newly_covered == 0` break is a redundant check if the initial check is correct and subsets are well-formed (non-empty where they should cover something). Let's remove the explicit `max_newly_covered == 0` break as the `while uncovered_elements:` condition combined with the fact that `max_newly_covered` would be 0 in the last iteration anyway (or the loop wouldn't run) is sufficient. If `uncovered_elements` remains non-empty after the loop (which shouldn't happen if the initial check passed), it implies an issue or an unsolvable state not caught. But the standard greedy doesn't stop until covered.
    
        # Let's revert to the standard greedy loop condition which implies searching until covered.
        # The max_newly_covered logic correctly finds the best subset.
        # The loop continues as long as there are uncovered elements.
        # If no subset provides new coverage (max_newly_covered is 0), but uncovered_elements is not empty,
        # this means the remaining uncovered elements are not in *any* of the available subsets.
        # This state is only possible if the initial check `universe.issubset(total_coverage)` failed,
        # or if the universe was empty initially (handled by the while loop), or subsets list was empty.
        # If the initial check passed, a cover *exists* using the full set of subsets.
        # The greedy algorithm guarantees it will find *a* cover if one exists, though not minimum.
        # The only way it wouldn't cover everything despite the initial check is if the universe contains elements not in any subset, which is caught by the initial check.
        # Or if subsets are empty. If subsets is empty, indexed_subsets is empty, the loop is skipped, uncovered_elements is still universe, and it returns []. If universe was empty, it returns [].
        # The max_newly_covered will be 0 if no subsets provide new coverage. If uncovered_elements is still not empty when this happens, something is fundamentally wrong (e.g., initial check failed, or universe has un-coverable elements).

        Solves the Set Cover problem using a greedy approximation algorithm.
    
        Given a universe of elements and a collection of subsets, finds a
        subcollection of subsets whose union covers all elements in the
        universe, aiming for a small size. This greedy approach provides
        a 2-approximation guarantee, meaning the size of the returned cover
        is at most twice the size of the minimum possible cover.
    
        The problem of finding the minimum size cover (optimal solution)
        is NP-hard. This function implements the standard greedy heuristic.
    
        Args:
            universe: A set of elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).
            subsets: A list of sets, where each set is a subset of the universe.
    
        Returns:
            A list of integers, representing the indices of the chosen subsets
            from the input 'subsets' list that form the greedy cover. Returns
            an empty list if the universe cannot be covered by the given subsets.
